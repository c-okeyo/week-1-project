        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Education Background and Work Experience </h2>
        <p>
            I am highly motivated electrical and systems engineer skilled in solution architecting,
             cloud technology, agile methodologies, enterprise architectures, product and network design, and network administration. 
             Currently, I am finding my footing in software development. Besides, I love reading and have lots of love for Liverpool FC and Lakers Basketball team. 
        </p>
        <h2> Why Programming</h2>
        <p>
            I am greatly fascinated by distributed systems and the ideas behind the inter-connections. However, I have found it not necessaritly not enough, just knowing which solution blocks works for specific situations. 
            It is the drive to know the specifics of different working solutions that have aroused my desire to try this murky waters. I beleive there is strength in understanding solutions end to end, right from conceptualizing the customers requirements,
            interperting the technical implications, designing the solution, to developing the right and working solution. The latter is the gap I am seeking to bridge.
