        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Education Background and Work Experience </h3>
        <p>
            I am an electrical and systems engineer skilled in solution architecting, cloud technology, 
            agile methodologies, enterprise architectures, product and network design, and network administration. 
            Currently, I am finding my footing in software development.

        <h3> Why Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I am greatly fascinated by distributed systems and the ideas behind their inter-connections. However, I have found it to be necessaritly not enough. It is the drive to know the specifics of different working solutions that has aroused my desire to try this murky waters. I beleive there is strength in understanding solutions end to end, right from conceptualizing the customers requirements,
            interperting the technical implications, designing the solution, to developing the right and working solution. The latter is the gap I am seeking to bridge.
